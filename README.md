## 🚀 CURRENT FOCUS (2024 – Present)

### DevOps Engineer | Cloud & Platform Engineering

I currently work as a **DevOps Engineer**, building **automation-first cloud platforms** that support scalable microservices and fast, reliable releases.

**What I actively do today:**
- Design and maintain **CI/CD pipelines** using GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Codemagic
- Provision and manage infrastructure using **Terraform (IaC)**
- Deploy and operate **containerized microservices on Kubernetes**
- Implement **rolling deployments, rollback strategies, and environment isolation**
- Improve release reliability through logging, validation, and monitoring
- Bridge development and operations with **developer-friendly DevOps systems**
